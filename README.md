# immigration_LinkedList
The "Visitor list in immigration department " program implements an  
application that creates a list of people at the moment when they arrive in
the immigration department. The officer at the department, has the option to  
insert a person to the first position, to the middle of the list, to the end  
of the list or in any other position too. Each option has its own method.  
Also the options to check the current position of a person by name, check  
current position by ID, update person's information, remove a person from the  
list by the ID and remove any number of people from the end of the list is  also available.
